# Persistent identifiers enduring Submission

This is an addition to [DSpace](http://www.dspace.org) (on github [@DSpace/DSpace](https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace)) to show persistent identifiers enduring the submission of any new item. It currently supports DSpace's JSPUI in version 5.8 only, but it should be simple to be ported to XMLUI or DSpace's version 6.x. If you need help porting it, please don't hesitate to contact [The Library Code](https://www.the-library-code.de).

## Branches

We will add one branch per supported version. Currently DSpace 5.8 is the only supported version yet: [dspace-5.8-addition](https://github.com/the-library-code/identifiers-enduring-submission/tree/dspace-5.8-addition).
